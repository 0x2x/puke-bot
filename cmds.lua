Embed Making:
  @Parameters:
    How to:
      If you would want to trigger the embed creation mechanism then you would simple add "{embed}" to when you want to start the creation.
      Otherwise it would just be all text. If you want to add different embed attrbutues then make sure to use "$v" for each parameter splitting them otherwise an error may occure.
      Double parameter section? no worries use "&&" to trigger different embed sections, Only works with author, fields, footer.
      When you trigger the reaction make sure to use brackets and colon like {name_parameter_here: hi}$v{more_parts_here: hi && ICON && URL}
                
    #embed > If you want to trigger the embed creation then you would just add {embed} when you want to start anything before {embed} would just be text
    #author > Multiple parameters: name && icon URL && external URL
    #title > If you would want to display a title inside the embed you would add "title" to it
    #description > If you want to add an description to your embed make sure to add the parameter "description"
